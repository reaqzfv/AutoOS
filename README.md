AutoOS is a WinUI3 application focused on automation to improve performance while ensuring privacy and compatibility.

## ✨ Features
- Automatically set every monitor to their highest supported refresh rate
- Automatically benchmark and apply GPU, XHCI Controller and NIC affinities and reserve them if enough cores
- Easily update GPU driver with one click
- Toggle XHCI Interrupt Moderation without having to restart your PC
- Toggle between service states with configured functionality
- Apply all hidden BIOS Settings in one click
- Custom Game Launcher supporting (Epic Games, Steam, Ryujinx)
- Automatically import Epic Games and Steam titles from old install
- Stop processes when running your game to automatically stop all unnecessary services and executables

## ⚠️ Current Issues
- **System Settings:** `Account -> Sign-in options` may not load after installing AutoOS.
   - **Workaround:** If you want to set a password or PIN, do so *before* installing AutoOS.
   - **Status:** The cause of this bug is currently unknown and it isn't easy to troubleshoot (sometimes it just starts working again).

## 💻 System Requirements

- AutoOS is currently only supported on x64 builds of Windows 11 23H2 `22631`
- 80GB of free storage

## 🚀 Getting Started

> [!NOTE]
> You must be signed in to GitHub in order to be able to download the artifact (Windows ISO) in Step 8!

**Step 1:** Open CMD as Admin and don't close it until the installation is done.

**Step 2:** Open Disk Management.

**Step 3:** Find your your C: partition / biggest partition.

**Step 4:** Right click on it and select "Shrink Volume".

**Step 5:** In "Enter the amount of space to shrink in MB:" input at least 65536 (=64GB) or higher. If you can't shrink that much space, use [Minitool Partition Wizard Free](https://cdn2.minitool.com/?p=pw&e=pw-free) (decline each offer in the installer).

**Step 6:** Right click on the "Unallocated" partition and select "New Simple Volume". Then just click next until you have a "New Volume". Then define this variable in the CMD window (e.g. E:).

```bat
set TARGETDRIVE=
```

**Step 7:** Go to the Drivers / Support page or your Mainboard / PC and download your LAN, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth driver (No Audio, Chipset, or anything else). On prebuilts you may also need the disk driver. Extract them all into one folder. Then define this variable in the CMD window.

```bat
set DRIVERDIR=
```

**Step 8:** Download the latest Windows ISO from the artifact [here](https://github.com/tinodin/uup-dump-get-windows-iso/actions/runs/17345528021). (Latest build from UUPDump - see [uup-dump-get-windows-iso](https://github.com/tinodin/uup-dump-get-windows-iso) for details)

**Step 9:** Extract the downloaded zip file.

**Step 10:** Extract the ISO file using 7-Zip / NanaZip / WinRar etc. Then define this variable in the CMD window.

```bat
set EXTRACTED_ISO=
```

**Step 11:** Apply `install.wim` to new partition.

```bat
DISM /Apply-Image /ImageFile:%EXTRACTED_ISO%\sources\install.wim /Index:1 /ApplyDir:%TARGETDRIVE%
```

**Step 12:** Create Panther directory, download [`unattend.xml`](https://github.com/tinodin/AutoOS/releases/latest/download/unattend.xml) and move it into the folder (THIS IS IMPORTANT!).

```bat
mkdir %TARGETDRIVE%\Windows\Panther && explorer %TARGETDRIVE%\Windows\Panther
```

**Step 13:** Install drivers.

```bat
DISM /Image:%TARGETDRIVE%\ /Add-Driver /Driver:%DRIVERDIR% /Recurse
```

**Step 14:** Create the boot entry.

```bat
bcdboot %TARGETDRIVE%\Windows & bcdedit /set {default} description "AutoOS" & label %TARGETDRIVE% AutoOS
```

**Step 15:** Restart your computer and boot into the default option. Then wait for Windows to finish installing.

**Step 16:** Once finished, wait for AutoOS to open up (On slower systems this may take a minute).

**Step 17:** Select your settings and click "Install AutoOS".

## 🙏 Credits

**Amitxv / Valleyofdoom:**  
Thank you for your [PC-Tuning Guide](https://github.com/valleyofdoom/PC-Tuning) and your useful utilities:  
- [AutoGpuAffinity](https://github.com/valleyofdoom/AutoGpuAffinity)  
- [service-list-builder](https://github.com/valleyofdoom/service-list-builder)  
- [TimerResolution](https://github.com/valleyofdoom/TimerResolution)  
- [ReservedCpuSets](https://github.com/valleyofdoom/ReservedCpuSets)  

Without your guide this project wouldn't exist. It inspired me to attempt to automate it and ultimately start this project.

---

**Revi Team:**  
Thank you for [SVCGROUP.ps1](https://github.com/meetrevision/playbook/blob/main/src/Executables/SVCGROUP.ps1), [useful registry keys](https://github.com/meetrevision/playbook/tree/main/src/Configuration/Tasks/registry) and for first introducing me to custom ISOs. Without the ReviOS project I don't know if I would have ever gotten into tweaking Windows.

---

**Imribiy:**  
Thank you for your research on [Configuring services and features](https://github.com/imribiy/XOS/tree/main/configure-services-and-features) and [AMD GPU Tweaks](https://github.com/imribiy/amd-gpu-tweaks).  

---

**Duckleeng:**  
Thank you for your research on [Receive Side Scaling (RSS)](https://github.com/Duckleeng/TweakCollection/tree/main/Research#which-nicsdrivers-support-receive-side-scaling-rss) and [Windows 11 24H2 AutoBoost Behavior](https://github.com/Duckleeng/TweakCollection/tree/main/Research#windows-11-24h2-autoboost-behavior).

---

**djdallmann:**  
Thank you for your research on [Network Performance](https://github.com/djdallmann/GamingPCSetup/blob/master/CONTENT/RESEARCH/NETWORK/README.md).

---

**m417z (Michael Maltsev):**  
Thank you for creating [Windhawk](https://github.com/ramensoftware/windhawk) and for helping me to publish my mod [Auto Theme Switcher](https://windhawk.net/mods/auto-theme-switcher).

---

**ghost1372 (Mahdi Hosseini):**  
Thank you for creating [DevWinUI](https://github.com/ghost1372/DevWinUI). It inspired me to learn C# and rewrite this project in WinUI 3. I appreciate your quick responses, fixes to issues, and the helpful [workflow file](https://github.com/ghost1372/DevWinUI/blob/main/.github/workflows/publish-release.yml), which I adapted for this project.

---

**rgl (Rui Lopes):**  
Thank you for creating [uup-dump-get-windows-iso](https://github.com/rgl/uup-dump-get-windows-iso), which I adaptet to automatically build the latest Windows release in order to speed up and simplify AutoOS installation.

---

**cschneegans (Christoph Schneegans):**  
Thank you for creating [unattend-generator](https://github.com/cschneegans/unattend-generator), which helps AutoOS installation to be seamless.
